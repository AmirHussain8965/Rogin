                <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
                <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be
                    distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at
                    its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
                    more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to
                    using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                    readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web
                    page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model
                    text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web
                    sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
                    over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
                    (injected humour and the like).
                </p>
                <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of
                    denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will
                    give you a complete account of the system, and expound the
                    actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
                    master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes,
                    or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but
                    because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
                    rationally encounter consequences that are extremely
                    painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or
                    desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but
                    because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and
                    pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
                    example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
                    exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who
                    has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy
                    a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who
                    avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
                </p>

                    and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the

                    duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying
                    through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are
                    perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour,
                    when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing
                    prevents our being able to do what we like best, every
                    pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in
                    certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the
                    obligations of business it will frequently occur that
                    pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The
                    wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this
                    principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other
                    greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse
                    pains."
